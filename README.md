# Iris Species Classification 🌸

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to build a simple machine learning model to classify Iris flower species using the famous Iris dataset.

## 📁 Project Overview

The Iris dataset includes 150 samples of iris flowers from three different species (*Iris setosa*, *Iris versicolor*, and *Iris virginica*). Each sample includes four features:

- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

The notebook walks through the full machine learning workflow:

- Data exploration and visualization
- Preprocessing
- Model training (using classifiers such as Logistic Regression or others)
- Model evaluation

## 📌 Files

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need Python installed along with the following libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
